# PriceHistoryScrapper
This is a Python app that is able to extract the prices (base & reduced) of a product from an inputed link
Expects a list of sites, each site/1 line (written in Products.txt) and it will output/append the prices in an excel file. 
For each product, a new spreadsheet will be created.
Also, when the price of a product drops down by a certain percent, a notification will be sent through email.
The purpose of this app is to save the history of certain products in order to analyse how the prices are varying.
